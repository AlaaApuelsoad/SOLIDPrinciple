        Open-Closed Principle
        The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.
        Modification means changing the code of an existing class, and extension means adding new functionality.
        We should be able to add new functionality without touching the existing code for the class, we're taking the
        risk of creating potential bugs so we avoid touching the tested and reliable production code
        Using Interface and Abstract class
